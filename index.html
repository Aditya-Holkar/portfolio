      <p>I was born on June 27, 1979 in Santa Cruz, California. I am the youngest of nine children.
         I am part Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese. I currently live in San Leandro, CA. I have two
         cats named Leeza (a calico cat) and Doobs (or Ruby, a black domestic cat).
      </p>

      <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering. I have worked for a little over 20
         years mostly in the tech industry. I worked at Intel after college for ten years and recently
         with General Atomics at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab for three years.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy performing in the theatre arts, mostly, singing, as a hobby. I also enjoy traveling -
         traveling every month for the last two years. When I am at home, I love cleaning, washing
         dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes.
