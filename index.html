                <p>I was born in Santa Cruz, California. I am the youngest of nine children.
                    I am of Asian descent with Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese lineage. I currently live in San Leandro, CA, 
                    in a house with four cats and three dogs! Not my own pets, but I have grown to love them
                    as my own, which reinforces my love for animals. I do have my own cats, two of them -
                    Leeza and Doobs!
                </p>
            </section>

            <p class="p-settings">I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering. I have worked for a little over 20
                    years, mostly, in the tech industry. I worked at Intel for ten years straight out of college and recently, at Lawrence
                    Livermore National Lab for three years. I really want to tap into my creative side thus my investment in coding 
                    bootcamp to hopefully reignite the passion that I need, to feel inspired in a work place. And at this moment, I am loving every day of it!
            </p>
               
            <p class="p-settings">I enjoy performing in the theatre arts, mostly singing, as a hobby, which definitely taps into my creative side. 
                        I love to travel, cook, drink wine, go to beach destinations, watch sunrise and/or sunset. When I am at home, I love 
                        cleaning, washing dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes.
