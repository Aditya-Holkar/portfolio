                    <p>I am a resident of San Leandro, CA, who recently just completed Full
                        Stack Web Development program at UC Berkeley adding to my Bachelor's degree in Electronics
                        Engineering. I have worked for a little over 20 years, mostly, in the tech industry. I worked at
                        Intel for ten years straight out of college and recently, at Lawrence Livermore National Lab for
                        three years.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I really wanted to tap into my creative side thus my investment in coding bootcamp
                        to hopefully reignite the passion that I need, to feel inspired in a work place. And at this moment,
                        I am loving every day of it! I hope to challenge myself to code everyday to hone my skills and find
                        a job where I can learn from great mentors and feel supported and encouraged so I could be a mentor
                        for others in the years ahead.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am highly independent, adaptable, timely, a fast learner, hard worker and a
                        doer. Constantly praised for excellent technical ability, organization and communication skills by
                        supervisors, engineers and peers - skills that helped me succeed in any job role despite not having
                        any prior knowledge of the field. I am confident that these traits I possess will also help me
                        succeed in this new endeavor I am going to partake.
