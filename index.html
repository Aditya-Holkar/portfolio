                <p>I was born on June 27, 1979 in Santa Cruz, California. I am the youngest of nine children.
                    I am part Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese. I currently live in San Leandro, CA. I have two
                    cats named Leeza (a calico cat) and Doobs (or Ruby, a black domestic cat). In addition, I live
                    in a house with four other cats and two dogs!
                </p>

            <p class="p-settings">I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering. I have worked for a little over 20
                        years, mostly, in the tech industry. I worked at Intel for ten years and recently, at Lawrence
                        Livermore National Lab for three years.
            </p>
               
            <p class="p-settings">I enjoy performing in the theatre arts, mostly, singing, as a hobby. When I am at home, I love cleaning, washing
                        dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes.
